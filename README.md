## *Technologies used*
Visual studio code 
- HTML, CSS, Javascript

## *Installation Instructions*
Github repository: https://github.com/ashleighmjohnson/LibraryforBooks 

## *Usage Guidlines*
- Click the 'New Book' Button
- Fill out the form completely, add the book name, authors name, and the amount of pages the book has. If you have read the book hit the check mark. If you have not - leave it blank.
- Click 'Add Book' to add it to your list
- Click 'Cancel' if you do not want it on your list

## *Future improvements planned*
- Database connection
- Separate spaces for Books read / Not Read
- Let users have the option to add comments
- Star system so users can rate the books 1/1.5/2/1.5/3/3.5/4/4.5/5 stars
- Better UI 
  

## Learning Outcomes
I learned how to handle JavaScript with 'adding' or 'creating' elements of html to the page as users complete the forms. For example: the book cards

## Chutzpah
- Added a rating system 1-5
  - Cannot enter a number above/below that or error happens
  - Sorts based on rating
